##Big Data

To set up this repository: open dataClean.R in rStudio and source the file. The first time running the file it will ask you to install a package, type ```y``` and wait for the download.

While this is happening, download the full dataset from ```https://www.hathitrust.org/sites/www.hathitrust.org/files/hathifiles/hathi_full_20150901.txt.gz``` using the command:
```wget https://www.hathitrust.org/sites/www.hathitrust.org/files/hathifiles/hathi_full_20150901.txt.gz```
in terminal
